One of the best ways to experience the San Juan Islands is by [taking a kayaking tour](https://www.crystalseas.com/cs-sj-tour-3hour.htm). With Crystal Seas, you’ll depart from Snug Harbor on the west side of San Juan Island and spend three hours exploring the sound and taking in the sights, from the Olympic Mountains to Victoria, BC. A kayaking tour mixes recreation with relaxation as you navigate the waters and enjoy the best views in the Pacific Northwest.

Best of all, you don’t need any previous kayaking experience to enjoy a Crystal Seas tour.

A kayaking tour is also the perfect all-ages excursion for families visiting the San Juan Islands. Children and adults alike will gain an education of the landscape and wildlife, and you’ll have the opportunity to see native species like bald eagles, harbor seals, river otters, starfish, white tail deer, [and (if you’re lucky) orca whales](https://www.crystalseas.com/guide/2018/04/09/canoing-puget-sound-orcas/).
