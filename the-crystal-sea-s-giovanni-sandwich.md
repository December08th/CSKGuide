If you've gone on a trip with us, it is likely you have had one of our Giovanni Sandwiches. We love these sandwiches so much, that I wanted to share the recipe with you all.

This sandwich is named for the bread used. The Il Pane Di Giovanni Loaf from Bakery San Juan is their signature rustic Italian bread. We ask for it in a baguette style to easier use it for small sandwiches. 

The other ingredients include: Mama Bird Farms Heirloom Tomato, Fresh Basil from Dancing Seeds Farm, Organic sliced Turkey, Fresh Mozzarella, Veganaise, Avocado, and of course our homemade Pesto! Optional fresh greens. 

This is one of the easiest sandwiches to make. All you do is spread on the Pesto and Veganaise to the bread and layer everything else on! 

Vegetarian's can enjoy this sandwich without the turkey, people who are gluten -free can turn this sandwich to a perfect caprese style salad, and vegan's can use dairy free pesto and drop the mozzarella and turkey.

Join us for a multi-day trip and experience the amazing cuisine we offer.
