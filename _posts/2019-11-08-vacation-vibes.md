Vacationing in the San Juan Islands can show you a part of our country where water and land join together in perfect harmony. Whether exploring the steep, sea star covered walls by kayak, wandering among the driftwood of South beach, or biking to Roche Harbor, we always feel more connected to the world around us than when we are off the island. The contrasting madrona trees spread their branches all over the island inviting us to relax and to take in the beauty of the world. The love for the Southern Resident Killer Whales is spread around and flyers describing efforts to help them can be found around town. It is this special place that Crystal Seas takes great pride in sharing with you, a place that we have loved for so long. But how can we keep that relaxed and satisfied vibe from our time in the San Juan Islands in our life all year round? We’ve got a few tips for you!

**Reflect and share**

Thinking about those moments that make your trip special can help bring back the mindset you were in when making those memories. Sharing your trip with others (and asking about trips they’ve had) is a great way to get past “small talk” and discover what your family and friends really care about. Having meaningful conversations will bring you right back to that relaxed vacation vibe.

**Print pictures that will remind you of the joy and hard work**

Surround yourself with pictures! Pictures are great reminders of the good times you’ve had and encourage you to get out and make more memories.

**Kayak, bike, and hike!**

Get those endorphins flowing! So many of our guests comment on how good an active vacation feels. Keep those endorphins up even when life gets busy! Making time for a leisurely bike ride or a hike through the park will help turn your vacation vibe into an everyday lifestyle vibe.

**Reach out**

We love hearing about the lifelong friendships made on our trips! Reach out to us and share your story. While you’re at it, call up the friends you made on your trip and plan your next adventure! The laughter that comes when reminiscing about a challenging crossing or a silly guide will put you in a positive mindset.

**Plan another trip**

One of the best ways to get those vacation vibes back is to go on another vacation! If you kayaked, check out our biking vacations! If you biked, try our kayaking vacations! And if you want to share the trip you already did with you family or friends, book it again! Tell us you are repeat customers and we will mix up some logistics so you get to see even more of the island!

Sharing the San Juan Island gives us an incredible amount of satisfaction. We want you to be able to take the feelings and experiences we share, bring them home, grow on them, and share them in an effort to share joy and happiness in our fast paced world. Maybe you will even come back and share the San Juan Islands with a friend or family member that hasn't made it here yet! Whatever you choose, thank you for sharing your time with us.
