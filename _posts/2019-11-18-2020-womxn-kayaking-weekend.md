Living an active lifestyle has helped me stay sane in the chaos of life. Whether I’m rock climbing, biking, skiing, or kayaking; I find myself staying grounded and meeting wonderful people. A game changer for me was when I first went rock climbing in an all women group. The entire vibe shifted. You see, the climbing community can be supportive and welcoming, but most often I find that climbers are there for themselves and will only support you if you can climb as hard as they do. When I was climbing with all women, the pressure to be good enough- disappeared. No matter how hard I climbed, I still was being supported. The women around me were there to support everyone and be support by everyone as well.

We are bringing this feeling of camaraderie, teamwork, and friendship to the San Juan Islands by introducing a Womxn’s only Kayak camp trip with Crystal Seas Kayaking during the summer of 2020. This trip will be a fully supported kayak camping trip guided by women. Come alone or with a friend; I am sure you will leave with friendships that will last.

This 3-day/2-night camping trip will meet in Friday Harbor, Washington on Friday, June 19th or August 14th and shuttle out to San Juan County Park. All gear is provided, so you only need to bring your clothing, toiletries, and sleeping bag (available to rent as well). From there, we will paddle and paddle, camping on Stuart Island for two nights and then returning to Friday Harbor on Sunday.

I believe that traveling with an all women group opens the doors to being 100% yourself in a pressure-free, relaxed environment. The challenges of a long day of paddling will be met with laughter, fun, and of course, wine. We will have opportunities to see wildlife, hike, lounge on the beach, and talk for hours around the campfire.

This will be a great opportunity to become closer to your friends and make new friends all while exploring the San Juan Islands by kayak! Click here to learn more!
