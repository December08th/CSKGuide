**Here’s what you need to know to plan a Friday Harbor day kayaking trip:**

First things first, you’ll need to make your way to Friday Harbor. Most visitors arrive via ferry from the Anacortes ferry landing, but if you’re coming from the Seattle area, you also have the option of traveling via air with Kenmore Air from SeaTac International Airport or Downtown Seattle or taking the Victoria Clipper directly from Downtown Seattle to Friday Harbor.

Our tour groups meet at Friday Harbor, the take a complimentary shuttle to Snug Harbor for a safety lesson and departure, and then [spend three hours taking you along the west side of the San Juan Island](https://www.crystalseas.com/cs-sj-tour-3hour.htm). You’ll have the opportunity to see wildlife and learn from our expert guides, who will give you a local perspective on the area with their knowledge of the habitat, wildlife, and surrounding areas. These tours are open to all ages and experience levels, and our team has your safety in mind every step of the way.

Once your tour is complete, we provide complimentary transportation back to Friday Harbor, where you’ll have the option to spend some time before returning to your destination. After a long day of paddling and sightseeing, you’ll surely have worked up an appetite and have the chance to enjoy Friday Harbor’s extensive dining options, whether you’re in the mood for lunch, dinner, or drinks. You can then take a ferry back, or extend your stay with accommodations on Friday Harbor or other areas of San Juan Island.
