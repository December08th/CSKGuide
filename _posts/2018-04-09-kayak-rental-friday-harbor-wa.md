While it is possible to rent a kayak and paddle around Friday Harbor we do not recommend it as much as we recommend kayaking up or down the west coast of San Juan Island.  Paddling the west side of San Juan Island is where you will have the best chance of seeing local wildlife such as bald eagles, harbor seals, jellyfish, starfish, white tail deer, river otters, and whales (  if you are lucky  ).

The west side of San Juan Island is home to the Haro Strait Special Management Fishery Area, False Bay San Juan Islands Marine Preserve, Lime Kiln Point State Park, San Juan County Park, Snug Harbor Resort, and many more interesting locations.

If you have already sea kayaked the south and west side of the island and are ready for a different experience you can rent kayaks from a local outfit named Friday Harbor Marine or call them at 360 378 6202.

Good luck and happy paddling!
