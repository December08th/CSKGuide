Whether it’s your first time visiting Seattle or it’s a frequent destination for your travels, exploring the Puget Sound is a must-do activity for your list. A day trip to Friday Harbor in the San Juan Islands is the perfect addition to your getaway: enjoy the lush scenery, sweeping views, and potential wildlife sightings in one of the most breathtaking locales in the northwest.

Our kayaking tours all begin from San Juan Island, and we offer complimentary shuttle pick-up in Friday Harbor. All you have to do is get yourself here!

Here are 4 easy ways to get to Friday Harbor from Seattle:

* Take the Airporter Shuttle from SeaTac Airport directly to the ferry landing in Anacortes, then walk on the ferry. Ferry walk-ons mean you don’t have to bring your car or wait in line, so we highly recommend this option for easy access during your day trip. (_2 hour shuttle trip, 1 hour ferry ride_)
* Drive from Seattle to Anacortes and take the Washington State Ferry. If you’re driving onto the ferry, you can make a reservation in advance to ensure your spot. (_2 hour drive, 1 hour ferry ride_)
* Take the Victoria Clipper (passenger ferry) from Downtown Seattle. You’ll board in downtown Seattle, and the drop-off location is right in Friday Harbor. (_3-3.5 hour trip_)
* Fly with Kenmore Air from downtown Seattle or SeaTac International Airport. This is among the pricier options, but will leave you plenty of time for exploring the island. (_40 minute flight_)

You can find more information on travel and accommodations [here](https://www.crystalseas.com/cs-sj-travel-info.htm).

Our three hour kayaking tours take you along the west side of the San Juan Island, where you have the best chance of seeing wildlife like bald eagles, harbor seals, white tail deer, [and (if you’re lucky) orca whales](https://www.crystalseas.com/guide/2018/04/09/canoing-puget-sound-orcas/). These tours are also perfect for families with children who want an immersive experience: no experience necessary.

Every Crystal Seas tour has your safety in mind. Our expert guides begin with a short safety lesson and will inform and entertain as you paddle the coastline of San Juan Island. Three hour tours are $99 per person plus tax and tip.
