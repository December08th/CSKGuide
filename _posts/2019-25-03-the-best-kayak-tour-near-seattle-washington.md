If you’re a first-time Seattle visitor or a Pacific Northwest local, there’s no better way to experience the area than with a [kayak tour in the San Juan Islands](https://www.crystalseas.com/cs-sj-tour-3hour.htm).

With Crystal Seas, you’ll have a personalized experience with small-group tours departing from Friday Harbor on the San Juan Island. [Our team of outdoor enthusiasts](https://www.crystalseas.com/cs-about-crystalseas.shtml) has been guiding kayak tours since 1994, and our history in the area ensures you have the best, most knowledgeable tour guides available. We’re dedicated to continuously educating and challenging ourselves to higher levels.

Our three hour kayaking tours take you along the west side of the San Juan Island, where you have the best chance of seeing wildlife like bald eagles, harbor seals, white tail deer, [and (if you’re lucky) orca whales](https://www.crystalseas.com/guide/2018/04/09/canoing-puget-sound-orcas/).

To experience one of our kayaking tours, you’ll need to get to Friday Harbor, either via the ferry from Anacortes, Washington, or via Kenmore Air or the Victoria Clipper direct from Seattle. Three hour tours are $99 per person plus tax and tip, and we offer complimentary shuttle pick-up in Friday Harbor.
