**Where can one go canoing in the Puget Sound and see Orca?** The west side of San Juan Islands are a popular spot for whale watchers to see orca. Canoing might be a bit risky because of the inherent instability of a canoe. We recommend a sea kayaking tour instead. :)

**How much does it cost to go canoing in the Puget Sound to see orca whales?** There are no outfitters on San Juan Island that rent canoes so you would need to bring your own to the island ( or paddle all the way to San Juan Island ) . Again; we recommend sea kayaking and not canoing. A sea kayaking tour on the west side of San Juan Island runs about $99 for a three hour tour ( plus tax and tip ) per person. [More details on our three hour sea kayaking tour here](https://www.crystalseas.com/cs-sj-tour-3hour.htm).

**Where else in the Puget Sound could we go Canoing to see orca?** One needs to be very lucky to see orca in a canoe or kayak; they are fast swimmers and cover swim over a hundred miles per day. Orca are known to explore into the deepest bays in the south Puget Sound but this is a rare occurrence. To give yourself and your family the best chance of seeing orca in the wild we recommend a [whale watching tour with San Juan Excursions](https://www.watchwhales.com) which departs from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island. These whale watching tours are $99 per person plus tax. The have a guarantee where if you don't see orca whales they will give you a rain check to go out with them again for free. The rain check never expires.

**If I stay in a vacation rental in Friday Harbor/San Juan Island will I get a discount on whale watching tours and sea kayaking tours?** Yes; if you stay at a rental managed by San Juan Property Management you get a coupon for 15% off orca whale watching and 10% off a sea kayaking tour.
