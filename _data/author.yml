text: Brooke grew up spending her time on the lakes, rivers, and forests of Michigan.
  She graduated from Central Michigan University in 2015 with a degree in Outdoor
  Recreation and Environmental Science all while spending almost every weekend biking,
  rock climbing, skiing or ice climbing. She spent her summers working at camps teaching
  youth how to kayak, canoe, sail, and paddle board. After graduating, she spent a
  year in Colorado working with youth and their families in the outdoors, inspiring
  environmental stewardship and sustainability through natural science education.
  She then took that mentality to Duluth, Minnesota where Lake Superior and the St.
  Louis river provided a perfect playground to kayak and whitewater raft. Since moving
  to Washington, she has fallen for the Salish Sea and the wildlife that call it their
  home.
